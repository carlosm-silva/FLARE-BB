Synthetic Data Generation
-------------------------

.. note::
   This module will contain tools for:

   * Generating synthetic gamma-ray light curves with known flare properties
   * Adding realistic noise and background to simulated data
   * Creating test datasets for algorithm validation
   * Performance benchmarking utilities

   The specific classes and functions will be documented here once the implementation is complete.
